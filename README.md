# RS-CC-coding
This project uses RS coding with circular coding. 
The randomly generated information is first passed through the RS code encoder, then through the Byte Inter-leaver and then into the cyclic code encoder. 
The reverse is true for decoding.
The combination is compared to obtain fewer errors.
